Pawcious Memories

What is Pawcious Memories?
Pawcious Memories is an app for pet owners to utilize to remember their current and former pets either adopted or fostered. Users can add pets, which creates a profile page of the pet. On the profile page, users can edit the pet's information (date of birth, date of adoption, breed, etc.), add memories of the pet, and add images of the pet. 

Why was Pawcious Memories created?
The team behind Pawcious Memories are current and former pet owners who have witnessed firsthand how important pets and the memories they have with them are to family. As years pass, it becomes more and more difficult to remember memories and details about pets. As a result, the team decided to create Pawcious Memories so that all pet owners have an easy solution to store their pets and remember them.
